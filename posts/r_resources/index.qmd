```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This is a list of links and resources related to common questions I get on how to get started with R for epidemiological studies.

### General

-   Your most comprehensive source of information regarding R will be [www.google.com](http://www.google.com>). Whenever you feel you have to ask someone for help, make sure the first entity you ask is google (*every time*).

-   As a close second comes the chatbots. MS copilot (GPT4) works great for me, but I am sure other up to date LLMs also works. You can ask them almost anything, including to write code for you. Be aware that they can hallucinate, so you still need to learn to understand the code.

-   I strongly recommend using the `tidyverse` packages which is a bundle including packages used for common tasks such as data wrangling (`dplyr`), tidying (`tidyr`), graphs (`ggplot2`) etc. Full documentation is found at [www.tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org). There you will also find cheat sheets and tutorials and is a good place to start. Tidyverse-style R is sometimes called a *dialect*, and is often perceived easier to read and write than regular R. Many new (non-tidyverse) packages are written to comply with tidyverse syntax principles. 

-   Cheat sheets for many common (mostly general) packages is found at [www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

-   Many packages has excellent documentation as well as `vignettes` which is a brief introduction to the package. They are available under each packages page on CRAN, [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org).

### Install R

-   First, install R: [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org) or [ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/](https://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/).

-   Then install Rstudio Desktop (you need an editor, and this one is very optimized for R) [www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

### Getting started / Learn basics

-   A good place for tutorials on many different aspects of R as well as general introductory courses is [www.datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com). Advanced courses costs money but are very good.

-   A Gentle Introduction to Tidy Statistics in R video: [www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/)

-   Learn R in R: [swirlstats.com](https://swirlstats.com)

-   Johns Hopkins R programming course: [www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming#syllabus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming#syllabus)

-   R for data science book and webpage: [r4ds.had.co.nz](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)

### Data import

-   Import SPSS files: package `haven`, [haven.tidyverse.org](https://haven.tidyverse.org)

-   Import Excel files: package `readxl`, [readxl.tidyverse.org](https://readxl.tidyverse.org)

### Data wrangling

-   `dplyr` and all other packages from `tidyverse` is the most straightforward and intuitive way to go about data wrangling and cleaning in `R`. Data wrangling is a big subject which includes a lot of different aspects of data handling and strategic decisions on how to structure your data. It is usually the most time consuming part of data processing in an epidemiological study. A good place to start reading is [r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html). [www.datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com) has good courses on this subject. Learning `dplyr`s *5 verbs* and using the [`pipe`](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-the-pipe-in-r-823090760d64) gets you a very long way. It is also highly recommended to have some knowledge about the concept of *tidy data* ([cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)).

-   Dates is a common source of anger. Use package `lubridate`. [lubridate.tidyverse.org](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org)

### Tables

-   Package `tableone`. A package that easily creates your *Table 1*. [link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tableone/vignettes/introduction.html).

-   Alternative to `tableone`: `gtsummary` [www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/). Builds on the `gt` package and is really good.

-   Advanced table customizing: There are *a lot* of different packages doing this. I find the best one to be `flextable`. The main upside is that it is very flexible and can output to MS Word format (which is useful as we unfortunately live in the dystopic reality of Microsoft world dominance.)

-   Using `flextable`, Michael Dismorr put together a very nice tutorial on how to format publication-ready baseline tables directly in R. Read his blog post [here](https://michaeldismorrmd.github.io/posts/publication-ready-tables-with-flextable-and-own-theme/).

-   A newer table package that will probably take over is `gt`. Can be a little cumbersome to export to MS word sometimes. It is very powerful for table customization, and the syntax is tidyverse-like.

### Graphics

-   Use `ggplot2` package: `ggplot2` (Included in and loaded with `tidyverse`). Useful together with the `pipe` operator and `dplyr`.

-   The `R graphics cookbook` is a comprehensive resource with sample code and instructions on most types of plots. It uses both `base R` as well as `ggplot2`. find it at [r-graphics.org](https://r-graphics.org)

-   The `R graph gallery` focuses on showcasing different types of plots and is generally more aesthetically angled than the `R graphics cookbook`. It nevertheless contains a lot of sample code and is a very good resource in finding appropriate visualisations for different types of data. URL: [r-graph-gallery.com](https://r-graph-gallery.com).

-   Kaplan-Meier / Survival curves is most often plotted using the `survminer` package. It is based on `ggplot` but uses proprietary syntax. Not ideal but widely used. Get started [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survminer/vignettes/Informative_Survival_Plots.html). A new alternative which I have started to use more and more is the `ggsurvfit` package, which is more ggplot-inspired. Really nice. [www.danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/).

### Survival analysis

-   Package `survival`. Part of `base R`. The one you want to use for Cox regression modeling.

-   Package `rstpm2`. When you want to do flexible parametric survival analysis (smooth curves).

### Other statistics

-   Regression modeling. Most relevant models are included in `base R`. (tip: linear model = `lm()`, logistic model = `glm(family = "binomial")`)

- For other, more advanced models, check out the new tidyverse package `tidymodels`. It introduces a common syntax between a lot of models, and makes it easy to play around with different ones. 

### Help and troubleshooting

-   Read the error messages. Twice. In almost all cases, the reason for your code not working will be found here, although not always totally obvious. Pro tip: copy and paste the error message to google.

-   You cannot define your function properly? always check the functions help pages at `?function_name` to find the function arguments and, often, examples.

-   Ask ChatGPT.
