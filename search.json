    "text": "Hi there,\nMy name is Christian Reitan and I am a medical doctor/PhD currently working in Stockholm, Sweden. I do research within the field of cardiology. I have a special interest for coding, preferrably in R, and I enjoy using coding tools for a (ideally) fully reproducible research process. My research focuses on on individuals with coronary artery disease, mainly using registries.\nThis is my personal webpage. I will use it to share basic information on me, and my CV (to do), and possibly tutorials or blog posts on random subjects related to my work."
