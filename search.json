    "text": "This is a list of links and resources related to common questions I get on how to get started with R for epidemiological studies.\n\nGeneral\n\nYour most comprehensive source of information regarding R will be www.google.com. Whenever you feel you have to ask someone for help, make sure the first entity you ask is google (every time).\nAs a close second comes the chatbots. MS copilot (GPT4) works great for me, but I am sure other up to date LLMs also works. You can ask them almost anything, including to write code for you. Be aware that they can hallucinate, so you still need to learn to understand the code.\nI strongly recommend using the tidyverse packages which is a bundle including packages used for common tasks such as data wrangling (dplyr), tidying (tidyr), graphs (ggplot2) etc. Full documentation is found at www.tidyverse.org. There you will also find cheat sheets and tutorials and is a good place to start. Tidyverse-style R is sometimes called a dialect, and is often perceived easier to read and write than regular R. Many new (non-tidyverse) packages are written to comply with tidyverse syntax principles.\nCheat sheets for many common (mostly general) packages is found at www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/.\nMany packages has excellent documentation as well as vignettes which is a brief introduction to the package. They are available under each packages page on CRAN, cran.r-project.org.\n\n\n\nInstall R\n\nFirst, install R: www.r-project.org or ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/.\nThen install Rstudio Desktop (you need an editor, and this one is very optimized for R) www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/.\n\n\n\nGetting started / Learn basics\n\nA good place for tutorials on many different aspects of R as well as general introductory courses is www.datacamp.com. Advanced courses costs money but are very good.\nA Gentle Introduction to Tidy Statistics in R video: www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/\nLearn R in R: swirlstats.com\nJohns Hopkins R programming course: www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming#syllabus\nR for data science book and webpage: r4ds.had.co.nz\n\n\n\nData import\n\nImport SPSS files: package haven, haven.tidyverse.org\nImport Excel files: package readxl, readxl.tidyverse.org\n\n\n\nData wrangling\n\ndplyr and all other packages from tidyverse is the most straightforward and intuitive way to go about data wrangling and cleaning in R. Data wrangling is a big subject which includes a lot of different aspects of data handling and strategic decisions on how to structure your data. It is usually the most time consuming part of data processing in an epidemiological study. A good place to start reading is r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html. www.datacamp.com has good courses on this subject. Learning dplyrs 5 verbs and using the pipe gets you a very long way. It is also highly recommended to have some knowledge about the concept of tidy data (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).\nDates is a common source of anger. Use package lubridate. lubridate.tidyverse.org\n\n\n\nTables\n\nPackage tableone. A package that easily creates your Table 1. link.\nAlternative to tableone: gtsummary www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary. Builds on the gt package and is really good.\nAdvanced table customizing: There are a lot of different packages doing this. I find the best one to be flextable. The main upside is that it is very flexible and can output to MS Word format (which is useful as we unfortunately live in the dystopic reality of Microsoft world dominance.)\nUsing flextable, Michael Dismorr put together a very nice tutorial on how to format publication-ready baseline tables directly in R. Read his blog post here.\nA newer table package that will probably take over is gt. Can be a little cumbersome to export to MS word sometimes. It is very powerful for table customization, and the syntax is tidyverse-like.\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\nUse ggplot2 package: ggplot2 (Included in and loaded with tidyverse). Useful together with the pipe operator and dplyr.\nThe R graphics cookbook is a comprehensive resource with sample code and instructions on most types of plots. It uses both base R as well as ggplot2. find it at r-graphics.org\nThe R graph gallery focuses on showcasing different types of plots and is generally more aesthetically angled than the R graphics cookbook. It nevertheless contains a lot of sample code and is a very good resource in finding appropriate visualisations for different types of data. URL: r-graph-gallery.com.\nKaplan-Meier / Survival curves is most often plotted using the survminer package. It is based on ggplot but uses proprietary syntax. Not ideal but widely used. Get started here. A new alternative which I have started to use more and more is the ggsurvfit package, which is more ggplot-inspired. Really nice. www.danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/.\n\n\n\nSurvival analysis\n\nPackage survival. Part of base R. The one you want to use for Cox regression modeling.\nPackage rstpm2. When you want to do flexible parametric survival analysis (smooth curves).\n\n\n\nOther statistics\n\nRegression modeling. Most relevant models are included in base R. (tip: linear model = lm(), logistic model = glm(family = \"binomial\"))\nFor other, more advanced models, check out the new tidyverse package tidymodels. It introduces a common syntax between a lot of models, and makes it easy to play around with different ones.\n\n\n\nHelp and troubleshooting\n\nRead the error messages. Twice. In almost all cases, the reason for your code not working will be found here, although not always totally obvious. Pro tip: copy and paste the error message to google.\nYou cannot define your function properly? always check the functions help pages at ?function_name to find the function arguments and, often, examples.\nAsk ChatGPT."
